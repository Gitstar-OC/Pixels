Pixels is a project made in NextJS and TailwindCSS which runs on the client side **mostly**. I got the idea to create it after seeing [this website](https://pixelate-me.vercel.app/) and there was no code / github link as it is **closed source**. So I thought why not to create it. 

Now **you may thiik that nextjs does server side rendering so how did I make this client side application?** Well for this as nextjs has `"use client"` I used it and there is also a  [github repository](https://github.com/t3dotgg/quickpic) which I used up a bit for reference as it does some thing similar to this project.

I have used the [3d card component](https://github.com/Hackclub-OC/pixels/blob/main/components/3d-card.tsx) from a UI Library called [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/) to save some time and effort.

**Have fun pixelating! your images**
